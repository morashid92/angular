== Fundementals of Angular.js

Following on from Dan Wahlin's tutorial on 'AngularJS in 60ish minutes', I pretty much note down the core basics of coding a SPA (Single Page Application) using HTML and Angular.js. I have commented most of the code and most of it seems like basic (that is if you are familiarised with MVVM or MVC). Either way enjoy! 

== Set up and running the application:

1. Clone Repository into your web server and open. If <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> then visit <tt>localhost/angular</tt>

2. The files and folders are relevant to the code implemented so just click on them to see angular in action.
